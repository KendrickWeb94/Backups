wedding rings
and love beef
i hate this

money cars fame and riches
dont mean shit
especially when you're 6 ft
waiting for a savior to come you from your deep shit
he arrives and you kill him
lover or girlfriend , pet her like an egg
the other eats her like a biscuit (haha)

the truth is straight but they twist it
dumb kids and dumb rizz
thats two dumb things  i gotta live with
am slowly coming to my senses
after i smoked weed that wanna make me perform census
like a boogeyman i came while you were sleeping
old lady no time for knitting
fuck sweaters even if its a cold world we live in
killers but we do it neatly
precisely
rightousely
wait i never stopped drinking
father forgive for the sins ive been commiting 
maybe a thousand more to come
i dont know ..just my thinking
but when the bombs goes out .. please tell me were ur hiding
you rich fat man who's greedy
got an ocean but wont hand us a mini sized fish
he tried to be gangster
but never how to the diss is
stop playing with her boobs
go wash those dishes

little kids aren't little kids
they become exposed right from the day they kick
but am waiting for the punchline
there's no nigga to draw the line so i can punch him
in a real fight
but i'd also use the pen skills
talking about how you good sing
we both know thats faker than a myth
irony of things is when u wanna swim
but cant float ... you hold too many grudges hoe
let it go
a slim bitch tried to kiss me with her stiff lips am sorry miss i dont do things
like this no more
